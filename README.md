# Measuring Student Learning and Teaching Efficacy through Classroom Transcripts

Authors: Jiner Zheng* &  Mike Hardy*

## Research Objectives:
- Classroom observations can provide valuable insights into student outcomes but are time-intensive and have low reliability even when done by expert human raters. We aim to develop quantitative, cost effective approaches to discover important overarching patterns and trends in and across classrooms using **classroom discourse transcripts**, paving the way for cost-effective feedback to educators of more than just one class.

## Data Source:
### NCTE Data
- [NCTE Elementary Math Classroom Transcripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11772) 
- [NCTE Main Study Data](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/36095/datadocumentation#) (value-added scores, expert rubric ratings, multiple contextual variables)

### Elementary Math Language Corpus
- a **novel collection** of discourse-style math language text from multiple publicly available resources (e.g.  [SFUSD Math Talks](https://www.sfusdmath.org/math-talks.html) , [engageNY](http://www.nysed.gov/curriculum-instruction/engageny))

## Key Research Methods & Ideas:
1. Tie Quality & Density of Mathematical Language to Impact
  - Create a high-quality, **age-appropriate math-dense corpus** with features to quantify elementary discourse to produce actionable insights, regressing them against multiple value-added measures
 
2. Tie Temporal Lesson Pacing to Student Outcomes:
  - Identify temporal structures that mark the most impactful instruction & lesson cycle to find multiple pathways to be a great teacher

3. Assess Student-Teacher Ratio and "Talk Moves" for Value-Added
  - Retrain the [TalkMoves Model](https://github.com/SumnerLab/TalkMoves) in our student/teacher talk ratio work
